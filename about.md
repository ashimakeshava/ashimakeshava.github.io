<!-- My picture -->

I am pursuing a PhD in Cognitive Science at the [NeuroBioPsychology Lab](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/research_groups/neurobiopsychology.html) at [The Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html). I am interested in studying human behavior in naturalistic environments. I am curious and random so pretty much everything piques my interests.
