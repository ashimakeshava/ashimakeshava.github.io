Welcome to my personal website!

I am pursuing a PhD in Cognitive Science at the [NeuroBioPsychology Lab](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/research_groups/neurobiopsychology.html) at [The Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html). I am currently funded by the [German Ministry of Education & Research](https://www.bmbf.de/en/index.html) for the project [ErgoVR](https://www.technik-zum-menschen-bringen.de/projekte/ergovr) in collaboration with [SALT AND PEPPER Software GmbH & Co. KG.](https://www.embodied.engineering/ergovr) and [Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology](https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en.html). I am also an Associated Researcher with the [Computational Cognition](http://computational-cognition.eu/) Research Training Group where I also serve as the Equal Opportunity Representative.

I am interested in studying goal-oriented human oculomotor behavior in naturalistic environments. I work with fully mobile experimental setups in virtual reality. Broadly, I am interested in Enactive and Embodied accounts of Cognition and how our environment _affords_ the possibility of (inter)action within it.

Besides my research, I also supervise BSc and MSc thesis projects and successfully taught a course on basics of data analysis in SS2019. I am a strong proponent of _Learning-by-doing_ and try to use similar principles for teaching and supervision.
