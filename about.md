I am pursuing a PhD in Cognitive Science at the [NeuroBioPsychology Lab](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/research_groups/neurobiopsychology.html){:target="_blank"} at [The Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html){:target="_blank"}, Osnabrück. My research projects have been funded by the [German Ministry of Education & Research](https://www.bmbf.de){:target="_blank"}, [European Funding for Lower Saxony](https://www.nbank.de/Unternehmen/Internationale-Gesch%C3%A4fte/Europ%C3%A4ische-F%C3%B6rderprogrammberatung/index.jsp){:target="_blank"} in collaboration with [Halocline & Co. KG.](https://halocline.io/en){:target="_blank"}. I am also an Associate Researcher with the [Computational Cognition](https://www.comco.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/startpage.html){:target="_blank"} Research Training Group. I obtained a M.Sc. in Cognitive Science with a focus on Computational Neuroscience and Neuropsychology at the University of Osnabrück, Germany and a B.E. in Electronics and Communications from Manipal Institute of Technology, India.

I use a data and technology-driven approach to study the neural basis of goal-oriented behavior in humans. In my projects, I have employed EEG, eye-tracking, and body kinematics in fully mobile virtual reality to understand how humans plan and execute actions. More broadly, I am interested in the Enactive and Embodied accounts of Cognition and how the body is an integral part of cognitive processing.

Besides my research, I supervise BSc and MSc thesis projects. I have also created an open coursework for [neuro-based data science](https://github.com/ashimakeshava/neuro_datasci){:target="_blank"} for absolute beginners where I teach how to work with behavioral, eye-tracking and EEG data. I am a strong proponent of _Learning-by-doing_ and try to use similar principles in teaching and supervision.
