Merry Christmas!

It's that time of the year again when I'm in a retrospective mood. I learned a lot this year and feel like I need to put it out there as a way of documenting the methods to my madness. And so there's nothing better than to spend my holidays playing around with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's great for creating static websites and integrates with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) like a charm. Why didn't I do this sooner?!
