In the winter of 2018, Peter asked me to prepare a data analysis course for absolute beginners. Throughout the spring, I made a rough sketch of what I wished I knew about data analysis when I was in the master's program. The result was a 12 week course during the summer of 2019 where my students learned how to set up their work environment in `python`, structure their data in `pandas` & `numpy` and use `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for quick data viz.

Inspired by my time at the Neuromatch Academy Summer School in 2020, I decided to modernize the course a bit more, so absolutely anyone who wanted to learn could just hop onto Github and work through the course material. You can see the result [here](https://github.com/ashimakeshava/neuro_datasci).

Students in SS2021 worked through google colab notebooks on publicly available datasets, and needed limited supervision as they went from one chapter to another. There's a lot I have to add here still, e.g. add youtube videos where I give demos, and talk through some concepts. This course is a work in progress and I plan on adding more material to it after I submit my PhD dissertation.
