I did my PhD with Prof. Peter König at the Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrück. During my PhD, I investigated the role of task, body, and environment in shaping oculomotor control. My work incorporates ideas from embodied cognition and computational ethology to understand how perception, action, and cognition unfold during continuous natural behavior. 


I use a combination of eye-tracking, 3D motion capture, and EEG to collect detailed behavioral and neural data in immersive virtual reality. I take a big data approach to understanding and modeling the complexity of natural behavior and neural data. My methods include dimensionality reduction, clustering techniques, mixed models, and predictive modeling to uncover patterns and relationships within high-dimensional, time-varying datasets.
